                <h2>Run-Buddy Website</h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first project. It was a pretent website for a fictional
                    company called Run-Buddy. It focused on building a website, but also
                    it taught me flex box skills and how css works with html to make a 
                    website.

                <h2> Reagans Website </h2>
                <p>
                    This is just a personal project so I can stay on top of my game. I 
                    wanted to put practical application to what I am learning about. Being 
                    able to push and pull repositories is a must everyday and this allowed
                    to keep doing this. Using Github and gitbash are neccessary for website
                    development. This whole project is just simply something made up about 
                    my daughter.

                    This is where I will update my Portfolio as I add additional projects. 
                    Showing what new applications and what new skills I have learned. This
                    section will be updated on a continual basis. I hope that you enjoy seeing
                    my new work.
